# IITIANS Greenovation 2025 – AI-Driven Green Hydrogen & Smart Energy Systems

This repository contains the prototype and simulation models for our solution submitted to **E-Cell IIT Bombay – Greenovation Challenge 2025**.

## 🌍 Problem
Steel and power sectors are the largest contributors to India’s carbon emissions (~40%).  
Current reliance on coal-based energy and steelmaking methods threatens India’s Net Zero 2070 goals.

## 💡 Our Solution
We propose an integrated approach combining:
1. **Green Hydrogen** from renewable-powered electrolyzers
2. **AI Optimization** for balancing renewable supply & industrial demand
3. **Smart Microgrids** to integrate hydrogen and renewables for steel & power industries

## ⚙️ Repository Structure
- `docs/` – Solution overview, presentation, architecture diagrams
- `data/` – Sample datasets for simulation
- `src/` – Core code (AI models, hydrogen simulation, microgrid modeling)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experimentation & results
- `tests/` – Unit tests for reproducibility

## 🛠️ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IITIANS/iitians-greenovation-2025.git
cd iitians-greenovation-2025
pip install -r requirements.txt
